                            <h2>Power BI Workshop Explanation</h2>
                            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                            <p>
                                In this Power BI workshop, the project focused on analyzing a dataset containing global GDP (Gross Domestic Product) data and sales data for various products. The GDP data was sourced from a comprehensive dataset of global economic indicators, specifically focusing on the GDP values for different countries across several years. The sales data, on the other hand, was collected from a CSV file containing detailed records of sales transactions across different quarters in 2021.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                The goal of the project was to explore, transform, and visualize this data to provide insights into economic trends and sales performance. For the GDP data, the objective was to highlight the top 5 countries with the highest GDP for the year 2019 and to observe trends over subsequent years. For the sales data, the aim was to clean and prepare the data for analysis, enabling us to track sales trends, product performance, and other key metrics.
                            </p>

                            <h3>1. Connecting and Visualizing Data</h3>
                            <p>
                                In this Power BI workshop, I started by connecting to my dataset and setting up the correct data types for each column using the <code>Table.TransformColumnTypes</code> command. For example, I defined the "Country" column as <strong>type text</strong>, the "Year" column as <strong>Int64.Type</strong> (64-bit integer), and the "GDP" column as <strong>type any</strong>, which allows it to accept any data type. This step was crucial to ensure that my data was properly understood and processed by Power BI.
                            </p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/Imagen1.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <p>
                                I then created a visualization that displayed the GDP of the top 5 countries for the year 2019. To do this, I filtered the data to focus on these specific countries and years, enabling a targeted analysis of the global economic leaders.
                            </p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/Imagen2.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="images/Imagen3.png" alt="" /></span>
                            <h3>2. Working with Data</h3>
                            <p>
                                Next, I loaded a CSV file ("2021-Q1-Sales.csv") using the <code>Csv.Document</code> function. This function allowed me to specify important parameters such as the file path, the field delimiter (comma), the number of columns (6), the text encoding (Windows-1252), and the quote style (<code>QuoteStyle.None</code>), which indicated that there were no text-enclosing quotes in the data.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I then promoted the first rows of the CSV file as column headers using the <code>Table.PromoteHeaders</code> function, setting <strong>PromoteAllScalars</strong> to true. This ensured that all scalar values were appropriately treated as headers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To maintain data consistency, I transformed the column types. For instance, "Order ID" and "Quantity Ordered" were set as 64-bit integers (<code>Int64.Type</code>), while "Product," "Order Date," and "Purchase Address" were set as text (<code>type text</code>). "Price Each" was also set as a 64-bit integer (<code>Int64.Type</code>).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I conducted a data quality check on several columns, including "Order ID," "Product," "Quantity Ordered," "Price Each," "Order Date," and "Purchase Address." The check revealed that 99% of the data was valid, with only a few missing entries in each column.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After ensuring data quality, I sorted the table in ascending order and grouped the data by quarters, naming the queries appropriately (e.g., "Juan_Consultas_Sales_Q1234"). This step helped in organizing and segmenting the data effectively.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I then combined the data from all quarters into a single table using the append function, which allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the entire year's sales data.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To further refine the data, I extracted cities from the "Purchase Address" column by selecting text between delimiters (commas). I also reformatted the columns, placing order-related information on the left and product details on the right, enhancing the clarity of the data.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After cleaning and transforming the data, I created several visualizations. These included bar charts that showed GDP over different years, as well as a line chart and a choropleth map highlighting GDP trends from 2019 to 2026 for the top 5 countries. I applied formatting options like bolding axis labels and adding trend lines to better interpret the data.
                            </p>

                            <h3>And now?</h3>

                            <p>
                                I am excited to continue developing my skills in data analysis and visualization, exploring new ways to use Tableau and Power BI to solve complex problems and create value through data interpretation. My next goal is to keep learning and applying these tools to more challenging and large-scale projects.
                            </p>
