							<h2>Theoretical Foundations and Their Use in the Code</h2>

							<h2>Conditional Value at Risk (C-VaR)</h2>
							<p>Conditional Value at Risk (C-VaR) measures the risk of extreme losses in a portfolio. It is the expected loss given that the loss has exceeded the Value at Risk (VaR) at a certain confidence level. C-VaR is useful for understanding the potential downside risk beyond the VaR threshold.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/cvarcode.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Source: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Conditional-Value-at-Risk-CVaR-Formula-11_fig3_361832965</p>
							<p>In the code, C-VaR is calculated for the stock returns and displayed as a measure of maximum expected loss over the selected time period. The C-VaR calculation is done using the calculate_cvar function, and the results are presented in the application's dashboard.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/cvar.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							
							<h2>GARCH Model.</h2>
							<p>The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is used to predict the volatility of stock returns. It models the variance of returns as a function of past variances and past squared returns, capturing volatility clustering observed in financial time series.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/garch.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The GARCH model is used to predict the volatility of stock returns. This predicted volatility is then displayed as part of the stock information, helping users understand the risk associated with their investments.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/garchcode.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							
							<h2>Logarithmic Returns.</h2>
							<p>Logarithmic returns are used to measure the continuous compounding rate of return over a period. They are preferred in financial modeling due to their time-additive properties.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/log_return.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In the code, logarithmic returns are calculated for each stock and used as input features for the LSTM model and other calculations, such as C-VaR and portfolio optimization.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/log_return_code.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							
							<h2>Portfolio Returns</h2>
							<p>Portfolio returns are calculated based on the weighted average returns of individual assets in the portfolio. In the code, portfolio returns are used to assess the overall performance of the user's investments. This is part of the portfolio information displayed in the dashboard.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/portfolioreturn.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							
							<h2>Garman-Klass Volatility</h2>
							<p>The Garman-Klass estimator is used to estimate the volatility of stock prices based on high, low, opening, and closing prices. It provides a more accurate measure compared to simple standard deviation.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/garmanklass.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The Garman-Klass volatility is calculated and used to assess the risk of individual stocks.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/garmanklass_code.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							
							<h2>Fama-French Three-Factor Model</h2>
							<p>The Fama-French model extends the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) by adding two factors to account for size and value effects. The three factors are market risk premium, size factor (SMB), and value factor (HML).</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/capm3factors.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Fama-French model is not directly implemented, but the concepts of risk and return are incorporated into the portfolio optimization process.</p>
							
							<h2>LSTM Neural Network</h2>
							<p>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. They are particularly effective for time series forecasting due to their ability to remember past information for long periods.</p>
							<p>The LSTM model is used to make short-term predictions of stock prices, which are then displayed on the dashboard.</p>
							
							<h2>How the LSTM Model Works</h2>
							<p>The LSTM model in this code is designed to predict stock prices based on historical data and various technical indicators. Here is a detailed explanation of how it works:</p>
							
							<h3>Data Collection and Preprocessing:</h3>
							<p>Historical stock price data is collected using the yfinance library. Several technical indicators are calculated and added to the dataset: Simple Moving Averages (SMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). Logarithmic returns are also calculated.</p>
							
							<h3>Data Normalization:</h3>
							<p>The data is normalized using MinMaxScaler to ensure that all input features are scaled to a range between 0 and 1. This is important for the performance of the LSTM model.</p>
							
							<h3>Training Data Preparation:</h3>
							<p>The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The training set consists of 95% of the data. Training data is prepared by creating sequences of 60 days of historical data to predict the next day's stock price.</p>
							
							<h3>LSTM Model Creation and Training:</h3>
							<p>An LSTM model is created using the Keras library. It consists of two LSTM layers and two dense layers. The model is trained on the training data for one epoch.</p>
							
							<h3>Model Serialization:</h3>
							<p>The trained LSTM model and the scaler are saved to disk using Keras and joblib, respectively. This serialization allows for quick loading and usage of the model in the web application, improving performance and reducing the need for retraining.</p>
							
							<h2>SARIMA Model</h2>
							<p>The Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model is used for time series forecasting, particularly for capturing seasonality and trends in the data. The model was tested using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to ensure stationarity, and differencing was applied to achieve better results.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/sarima.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>SARIMA model is used for medium and long-term predictions of stock prices. The SARIMA predictions provide insights into future trends and seasonality in stock prices.</p>
							
							<h2>Logarithmic Returns over multiple periods for Portfolio Performance</h2>
							<p>Logarithmic returns are used to measure the continuous compounding rate of return over multiple periods. They are particularly useful for evaluating the performance of the portfolio over time.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/logaritmic_return_variusperiods.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In the code, logarithmic returns are calculated to determine the portfolio's overall performance since the initial purchase. This is displayed on the dashboard to inform users about the gains or losses of their investments.</p>
							
							
							
							
							
							<h2>Future Implementations</h2>
							<p>We aim to implement a functionality that will teach personal finance using AI, providing users with personalized financial advice and educational content. Additionally, it is important to note that all the money shown in the current application is fictitious. We plan to implement a feature in the future that will allow users to add and manage real money within the application, enhancing its practicality and usefulness for personal financial management.</p>
