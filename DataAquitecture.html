                                    <div class="content">
                                        <p>The Restaurant Manager platform is designed to streamline the operations of a restaurant by managing orders, inventory, staff, and finances. The platform is underpinned by a robust database structure that ensures efficient data handling and security. It utilizes various triggers to automate updates to critical tables such as inventory, profit, and availability of dishes based on real-time events in the system.</p>

                                        <h3>Triggers and Automation</h3>
                                        <p>The platform employs several triggers to automate tasks and ensure data integrity:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Inventory Management:</strong> A trigger ensures that when an ingredient is used, the inventory is automatically updated. If an ingredient is insufficient, the associated dish is marked as unavailable.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Profit Calculation:</strong> A trigger automatically updates the profit and revenue tables whenever an order is marked as paid or when a new cost is recorded.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Order Management:</strong> Triggers handle the status of orders, moving them to inactive orders if they cannot be fulfilled due to a lack of ingredients.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h3>Entity Relationships</h3>
                                        <p>The platform's database structure includes several entities that are closely interrelated to ensure seamless operations:</p>

                                        <h2>Password Security</h2>
                                        <p>To ensure the security of user data, especially passwords, the platform uses hashed passwords stored in the database. This approach ensures that even if the database is compromised, the actual passwords remain secure. The system employs secure hashing algorithms to generate a hash from the user's password, which is then stored instead of the plaintext password.</p>
                                        <img src="images/ImagenContraseñashash.jpg" alt="Password Hash Example" />
                                        <h2>Conceptual Data Modeling (CDM)</h2>
                                        <p>The platform is based on a Conceptual Data Model (CDM) that describes the criteria and capabilities of data domains within the restaurant management context. The CDM defines the structure of data and its relationships, ensuring that all data elements are consistently and accurately represented across the system.</p>

                                        <h2>Information Reference Model (IRM)</h2>
                                        <p>The Information Reference Model (IRM) illustrates the relationships between defined information entities based on their data domain classification. It ensures that the data model aligns with the business objectives and supports the operational needs of the restaurant.</p>

                                        <h2>Enterprise Information Model (EIM)</h2>
                                        <p>The Enterprise Information Model (EIM) encompasses both the Conceptual Data Model (CDM) and the Information Reference Model (IRM). It provides a comprehensive framework that supports data consistency, integrity, and accessibility across the entire platform, aligning the data architecture with the business strategy.</p>

                                        <h3>Demo Video</h3>
                                        <p>To see how the platform works in practice, watch the following demo video:</p>
                                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fCqCommoeKc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                                        <h3></h3>
                                        <h3>Permissions and Security</h3>
                                        <p>The platform includes a comprehensive permissions system that assigns roles to users and grants them specific privileges based on their role. For example, chefs have permissions to view and update dishes, while waiters have permissions related to orders and tips. These permissions are managed through the MySQL database and enforced through stored procedures and triggers, ensuring that users can only access data relevant to their role.</p>

                                        <p>The platform uses triggers to automate the assignment of privileges to users when they are created. Additionally, the platform's triggers ensure that profit calculations are updated automatically whenever an order is paid or when a new cost is recorded, maintaining accurate financial records.</p>
                                        <p>This hands-on project allowed me to apply the principles learned in the Cloud Data Security course, ensuring that data protection and efficient management practices are embedded in real-world applications.</p>
